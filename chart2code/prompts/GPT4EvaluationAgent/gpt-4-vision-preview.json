    "instruction": "You are an excellent judge at evaluating visualization chart plots. The first image (reference image) is created using ground truth matplotlib code, and the second image (AI-generated image) is created using matplotlib code generated by an AI assistant. Your task is to score how well the AI-generated plot matches the ground truth plot.\n\n### Scoring Methodology:\nThe AI-generated image's score is based on the following criteria, totaling a score out of 100 points:\n\n1. **Chart Types (20 points)** Does the AI-generated image include all chart types present in the reference image (e.g., line charts, bar charts, etc.)?\n2. **Layout (10 points)** Does the arrangement of subplots in the AI-generated image match the reference image (e.g., number of rows and columns)?\n3. **Text Content (20 points)** Does the AI-generated image include all text from the reference image (e.g., titles, annotations, axis labels), excluding axis tick labels?\n4. **Data (20 points)** How accurately do the data trends in the AI-generated image resemble those in the original image and is the number of data groups the same as in the reference image?\n5. **Style (20 points)** Does the AI-generated image match the original in terms of colors (line colors, fill colors, etc.), marker types (point shapes, line styles, etc.), legends, grids, and other stylistic details?\n6. **Clarity (10 points)** Is the AI-generated image clear and free of overlapping elements?\n\n### Evaluation:\nCompare the two images head to head and provide a detailed assessment. Use the following format for your response:\n\n\n---\n\nComments:\n- Chart Types: ${your comment and subscore}\n- Layout: ${your comment and subscore}\n- Text Content: ${your comment and subscore}\n- Data: ${your comment and subscore}\n- Style: ${your comment and subscore}\n- Clarity: ${your comment and subscore}\n\nScore: ${your final score out of 100}\n\n---\n\nPlease use the above format to ensure the evaluation is clear and comprehensive.\n",

    "instruction": "You are an expert Python developer who specializes in writing matplotlib code based on a given picture. I found a very nice picture in a STEM paper, but there is no corresponding source code available. I need your help to generate the Python code that can reproduce the picture based on the picture I provide.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and detail in your recreation, begin with a comprehensive analysis of the figure to develop an elaborate caption.\nThis caption should cover, but not be limited to, the following aspects:\n1. Layout Analysis: e.g., identify the picture's composition, noting the presence and arrangement of any subplots.\n2. Chart Type Identification: e.g., determine how many charts within a subplot. Are they independent, or do they share a common axis?\n3. Data Analysis: e.g., summarize the data trend or pattern.\n4. Additional Features: e.g.,identify any supplementary elements such as legends, colormaps, tick labels, or text annotations that contribute to the figure's clarity or aesthetic appeal.\n\nNow, given the picture below, please first output your comprehensive caption and then use the caption to assist yourself to generate matplotlib code that reproduces the picture.\nNote that it is necessary to use figsize=({width}, {height}) to set the image size to match the original size.",

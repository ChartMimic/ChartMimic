    "instruction": "You are an expert Python developer who specializes in writing matplotlib code based on a given picture. I found a very nice picture in a STEM paper, but there is no corresponding source code available. I need your help to generate the Python code that can reproduce the picture based on the picture I provide. \n\nI will provide you with two images. The first image is the original picture. The second image is the picture overlaid with a dot matrix of a shape of {height_int} * {width_int} to help you with your task, and each dot is labeled with two-dimensional coordinates (x,y). Within each column, the x-coordinate increases from top to bottom, and within each row, the y-coordinate increases from left to right.\n\nPlease first use this dot matrix as reference anchors to generate the description of the picture (e.g., between dot A and dot B is something) and generate matplotlib code that reproduces the picture.\n\nNote that it is necessary to use figsize=({width}, {height}) to set the image size to match the original size.",
